# JetPack Project

### Introduction

The JetPack project is an attempt to create a new ecommerce environment entirely rooted in the Go Language and designed with 4 key goals in mind:

1.	Speed - Of course we want to be the fastest ecommerce on the planet
2.	Componentized - Each jetPack component will be able to be used as a standalone component so if you come from another system you can use Jetpack Pricing for example without having to migrate in a "Big Bang" fashion.  We believe that once you see the power you will never want to go back to your old style ecommerce platform.
3.	Extensibility - Once you have a JetPack component you can add-on as much as you want even your own home developped extensions.
4.	Stability - What good is all the rest of the qualities mentionned above if the thing crashes every 5 minutes :)

We also will be using Docker as a deployment strategy for JetPack which will allow you to be up and running easily
